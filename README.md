# Data Sourcing Challenge

This repo contains code for predicting Geomagnetic Storms (GST) by extracting data from the NASA API, specifically from two sources—its GST data and its Coronal Mass Ejections(CME) data—then merge the data together and compute the average time it takes for a CME to cause a GST

These storms are caused by so-called Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), which are a massive bursts of plasma emitted from the Sun in irregular intervals, that Earth's magnetic shield fortunately renders harmless to us. However, this interaction with the magnetic shield can still create so-called Geomagnetic Storms (which also cause the Northern and Southern Lights) that can be harmful to electronic devices such as satellites, GPS systems, and essential parts of our powergrids.

NASA and the Space Weather Prediction Center operate a number of measuring satellites that collect data on CMEs. This data is then used to warn powergrid operators and GPS system operators ahead of time, so that they can make necessary adjustments. 

## Report

Here is the data that describes the CME to cause GST. And the relevant data can be found under ouput folder
